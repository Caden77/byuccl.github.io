  description: >
    During the week of August 28-September 1st, Michael Bjerregaard and Garrett Smith had the opportunity to participate in a radiation test at the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)](https://www.lbl.gov/). They attended to support a test of the Versal DUT card created by the Xilinx Radiation Test Consortium and to validate the function of the BYU JTAG configuration module (JCM). They were able to help finish setting up to power cabling for the Versal DUT card and place it in the beam. The system performed successfully and we were able to scrub configuration upsets in the Versal part while logging both the upsets and the statuses reported from the part itself. Although there were a number of setbacks, during the setup and test run, the experiment successfully collected programmable logic CRAM upsets at a high rate and determined cross section measurements. The BYU team is looking forward to testing again with more complex designs and more stringent testing conditions.

  date: 2022-12-20
  description: >
    Researchers from the CCL traveled to the [Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE)](https://lansce.lanl.gov) to verify the reliability of various computer reliability methodologies. The experiments performed at LANSCE were a testing methodologies for multicore SoC (System-on-a-Chip), an improved Linux PCAP scrubber, radiation hardened softcore processors, a DDR memory module and attempting to generate bit upsets data for FRAM chips continually performing reads and writes. The image on the left are the experiments exposed to the neutron radiation beam and on the right are researchers involved.

  description: > 
    Researchers from the CCL and [Sandia National Laboratory](https://www.sandia.gov/) traveled to the Little Mountain Test Facility in Ogden, Utah to use the [LINAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator) for computer reliability testing. An SRAM chip (a commonly used component in bigger devices) was irradiated at varying intensities and durations to characterize its response. The people in the image on the left are (from left to right) Dolores Black (SNL), Jeff Black (SNL), Wesley Stirk (CCL), Roy Cuoco (SNL), Mike Wirthlin (CCL), and Jeff Goeders (CCL).

    Students from the CCL traveled to the [Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE)](https://lansce.lanl.gov) to perform a variety of experiments related to computer reliability. Experiments included testing of a Linux-based PCAP scrubber, radiation hardened softcore processors, SoC (System-on-a-Chip) radiation testing methodologies, and FPGA fabric characterization under radiation. The image on the left shows the experiment boards lined up for the neutron radiation beam. The image on the right shows the participating students on the first day of the experiments (and the first day of school).

  date: 2019-11-14
  description: >
    Students journeyed to [ChipIr](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/ChipIR.aspx) equipt with several experiments and a desire to discover the unknown. Like LANSCE, ChipIr also provides an accelerated neutron source that is similar to neutron radiation found in the Earth's atmosphere. A half dozen different boards were included in this test. Experiments covered novel scrubber techniques, structrual redundancy on a RISC-V processor, multi-cell upset detection on the newer FPGA architectures, the use of the [Soft Error Mitigation (SEM) Core](https://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/sem.html), and the use of partial circuit replication techniques on academic and commercial FPGA-based networking applications. Experiments were staffed around the clock; students back at BYU remoted into the experiments while those attending prepaired for the next day. A breif visit was made to the nearby historic town of [Abingdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abingdon-on-Thames) for dinner one eveing, and Oxford 1st ward was attended on Sunday, the second to last day.

  description: >
    Students from the CCL traveled to the [Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE)](https://lansce.lanl.gov) to evaluate their work on computer reliability in harsh radiation environments. LANSCE provides an accelerated neutron source that mirrors the atmospheric neutron radiation found here on Earth. Several experiments were conducted accross a dozen different boards (left). Some experiments quantified improvements in reliability gained from using structural reduncancy (multiple copies to mask or detect an error) and automated software fault tolerance techniques. Another experiment targeted multi-cell upset detection. A final experiment evaluated novel configuration scrubbing techniques. Busy at the beam, students and adviors alike tended experiments and analyzed data in a remote data room (center). While things were running smoothly, a visit was made to the nearby [Bandelier National Monument](https://www.nps.gov/band/index.htm) (right).

  date: 2019-02-22
  description: >
    After almost a year of direct collaboration with BYU CCL students the Xilinx PYNQ team has released a new PYNQ image. One of the featured improvements for this release is new Partial Reconfiguration functionality, a direct result of the collaboration between the PYNQ team and PRIO team. In conjunction with this release the BYU CCL also released a new pip installable python package, complete with a full suite of examples demonstrating this functionality. The release was given the name Utah as a reflection of the contributions made by the PRIO team.
